## About me:

I’m a generalist and have held different roles in different places throughout the years. I was a Policy Support Officer at a diplomatic mission, a [European People’s Party trainee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_People%27s_Party), a PR/PA consultant, and a jack-of-all non-technical task employee at [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/). I was an early joiner and my role ranged from all-around customer service to ops, did it all. 

I am interested in a lot of subjects. Here are some [books](/books/) I have enjoyed over the years, which cover anything from history, physics, India, and self-development. 

## What am I doing now?

Currently, I am trying my utmost to read and learn about the many facets of AI policy and governance. There aren’t many Poles working on this subject nor is it well-covered in our media, so it’s an excellent topic to learn a couple of definitions so one can display their intellectual prowess to their family during Sunday lunch. Besides the obvious status rise of this self-education, AI policy requires some kind of knowledge of philosophy, history, computer science, [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/), politics, data privacy, copyright law, and more. 

There is a lot to cover but it’s all connected and I have professional experience with most of the topics that cover AI policy. However, it seems, that to really delve into the subject one needs to read very widely and take courses, which have the benefit of testing your knowledge but also to meet like-minded peers. To structure my education, I borrowed some of the ideas from Tim Ferriss’s article on [How to Make Your Own Real-World MBA](https://tim.blog/2010/06/28/mba/) and I have decided to create my own little Master’s degree course - which remains unnamed but will have AI in it. 
 
## Why?

Why all this? Why make the effort and [put in the work and climb this mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_choose_to_go_to_the_Moon)? Well, I am internally compelled to the field of AI policy and I would like to eventually develop it in my home country. To do so, I need to equip myself with the toolset to make sense of the technological wave we are riding as a global society. 

## My own real-world MBA
